Stock Replenish Report Secondary Unit
=====================================
This module allows to have, in the inventory forecast report, the forecast quantities in the 2nd unit of measurement.

Usage
-----
As an inventory user, I go to the form view of an product/variant and click on the `Forecasted` smart button.
