Stock Production Lot RMA
==========================
This module allows to access the list of linked RMAs from the lot / serial number.

Usage
-----
As a user with access to the Inventory app, I go to `Inventory > Products > Lot/Serial Numbers`.

I am accessing the form view of a Lot/serial number.

I see a new smart button called RMA is available.
