Since the version 1.0.3 :

As an Inventory user, I go to the form view of an item/variant and click on either of the stock smart buttons.

* I notice that a new column `2nd Unit Available` is present, between the `2nd Unit On Hand Qty` field and the `2nd unit` field.

As a member of the `Inventory / Administrator` group, I go to `Inventory > Reporting > Inventory Report`.

* I notice that a new column `2nd Unit Avalabale`  is present, between the `2nd Unit On Hand Qty` field and the `2nd unit`  field.
