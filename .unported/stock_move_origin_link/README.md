This module adds the `Source Document` to the list view of stock pickings and stock moves.

The text is clickable if it refers to an object within the supported types.

For example, in the example above, when clicking on `MO/00003`, the user is redirected to the
form view of the production order.

## Supported Origin Documents

The module supports the following documents as origin of a stock move:

* Sale Orders
* Purchase Orders
* Manufacturing Orders

However, the module only depends on the `Inventory` app.
It detects automatically whether the `Sales`, `Purchases` and `MRP` apps are installed.
