Product Quant Package Dimension
===============================
Add height, width and length to a stock quant package with its UOM for each field.

Usage
-----
As an User of Inventory, I go to ``Inventory > Products > Packages``.

In the form view, I can see three new fields: ``Height``, ``Width`` and ``Length`` that can be in decimal value.
I also can change the unit of measure of each property to ``m`` or ``ft``.
