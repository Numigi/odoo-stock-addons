The PO lines are colored based on the turnover rate:

* Green: the turnover rate exceeds the target turnover rate
* Gray (uncolored): the turnover rate is lower than the target turnover rate but higher than the minimum turnover rate
* Red (uncolored): the turnover rate is lower than the minimum turnover rate
